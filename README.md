# OpenStrata
We are the Open Strata Team, an open-source initiative dedicated to creating a comprehensive framework for cloud governance and Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) within cloud environments. Open Strata is designed to help organizations efficiently manage cloud resources, enforce governance policies, ensure compliance, and streamline application development and deployment processes.

Our charter includes engaging with key enterprise customers and guiding their cloud platform implementation to success. We aim to share the valuable insights and best practices we learn from these engagements through comprehensive guidance and tools, and to celebrate the success of our users and contributors by highlighting compelling stories and use cases.

This repository contains the Open Strata framework and related resources, available at (https://github.com/Open-Strata).
